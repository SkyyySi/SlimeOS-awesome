# Flexi Launcher

## Summary

A flexible launcher widget for the Awesome window manager!

## Description

The Awesome window manager (just Awesome form here on) has shipped the `menubar` widget for a long time. However, if you wanted to make something more like a traditional desktop launcher, a full screen app grid, or really any other launcher style, you were basically out of luck and had to make your own one from scratch. Flexi Launcher aims to fix that. It is designed around a very *flexi*ble API that allows you to mold it into any launcher paradime you want. It also exports its internally used menu structure, so if you prefer, you can also use that as a starting point to make your own, for example if you just want to populate a plain `awful.menu` (although the provided examples also include one).
